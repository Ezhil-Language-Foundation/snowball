Using the library
=================

There is currently no formal documentation on the use of the Java version
of the library.  Additionally, its interface is not guaranteed to be
stable.

The best documentation of the library is the source of the TestApp example
program.

The TestApp example
===================

The TestApp example program allows you to run any of the stemmers
compiled into the libstemmer library on a sample vocabulary.  For
details on how to use it, run it with no command line parameters.
